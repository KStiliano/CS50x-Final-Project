#### Description:
For my culminating project, titled "MyProgressions," I have developed a simple yet valuable website employing a blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. As a fervent music enthusiast, I endeavored to create something not only personally gratifying but also universally beneficial. but I was brainstorming about it and I spent quite some time thinking in which direction I would go music-wise, so after a little while I decided that I would do a chord progression generator and then from there on I finished my thought-process.
The core of my project resides in the "app.py" file, a Python script that serves as the nexus connecting all HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL components. Facilitated by the micro-framework "Flask," this integration ensures seamless interplay among diverse elements. Additionally, I have modularized the code by segregating certain imports and definitions into a distinct Python file named "help.py." This organizational approach not only enhances clarity but also contributes to the overall tidiness of the project.
Within the website, users encounter sections for "login," "register," and "logout," featuring input fields for respective actions. Post-login, users are greeted with a homepage. One of the features is the "keys chart," housing a circle of fifths that organizes chromatic pitches in perfect fifths. This visual aid, conforming to the standard 12-tone equal temperament system, serves to elucidate the closely related key signatures in a circular format.
The "chords chart" segment provides a comprehensive list of major and minor chords within a key, accompanied by hyperlinks redirecting users to external resources for piano and guitar chords. The "chord progression generator" is a highlight, furnishing users with the top 5 most common progressions based on their selected key. Upon submission, users are directed to a results page displaying the chosen key along with the corresponding top 5 progressions and their constituent chords.
Furthermore, the "create progression" feature empowers users to devise custom progressions by specifying a key, desired progression, and corresponding chords. Upon submission, users are redirected to their personalized "profile" page, where their custom progressions are stored for future reference.
In crafting the website's design, I embraced a minimalistic approach, drawing inspiration from the simplicity of sheet music. This deliberate aesthetic choice imbues the website with a refined and scholarly ambiance.
In conclusion, "MyProgressions" stands as a testament to my dedication to music and programming, harmonizing technical proficiency with a user-centric design philosophy. The project not only offers a practical utility in the realm of music but also showcases a commitment to an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user experience.
